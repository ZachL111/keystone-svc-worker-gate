# keystone-svc-worker-gate

`keystone-svc-worker-gate` explores backend services in Kotlin. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Keystone Svc Worker Gate Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Feature Notes

- Includes extended examples for queue pressure, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents bounded workers tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Why This Exists

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Implementation Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying backend services behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Kotlin version keeps data classes and model logic close together for a JVM-friendly core.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Example Scenarios

`surge` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `accept` path with a score of 224. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -41 and `surge` at 224, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Boundaries

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Roadmap

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more backend services fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with Kotlin available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
